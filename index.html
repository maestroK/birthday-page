        content: "Meine Traumfrau, I read about your favorite childhood candy. It was hard to find at first because the spelling you gave me was wrong (I know im a smarty pants). The real spelling is alpenliebe. How did I crack this? Because there was a brief period in my life where I learned german ( yes just for fun). Alpen means the swiss alps and liebe is german for love. So the name stands for â€˜love of the alpsâ€™. The name is chosen so that the candy evokes an image of the beautiful, lush swiss mountains, also Switzerland is known for its chocolates so the name gives it a sense of authenticity and purity.\n(meine traumfrau means my dream woman)\nThe thing about being with a genius is that whenever you think you know him all. Youll find something amazing you didnâ€™t know. \n(please be ready for letters in Pashto, Urdu, English, Spanish and German (im also planning on learning French soâ€¦. )\nLove, Sam"

Men I looked dead in the eye. Men who told me\nmy directness will be my death one day.\nHow long before you heal them with a soft kiss, just a slide of your thumb\nMy mind was always too much for me. I was given too powerful a mind and not enough to\nsatisfy its cravings.. I fed it with toxins. Not to kill it. Maybe to put it to sleep while I work on\nearning enough to let it play.\n\nHow many more gutkapainted walls, harsh horns,\nBefore I watch you stroke a catâ€™s chin, talk in meowish.\nHow many more naked Karachi cuss words,\nBefore I can enjoy your Emirati accent, tweak Punjabi words.\n\nI was born into a world not made for me. So, I decided to build my own world.\nHow long before you become its first inhabitant.\nHow long before I watch the Pashtun breeze flap your long black hair,\nMake your breasts move to and fro.\n\nI was a man of few words, too many thoughts. You made me a man of few thoughts, too many\nwords.\n\nSigh, how powerful, how compelling is the beauty of your puerile behavior that it changed me.\nhow special that only I, Sam, gets to see this side of you. Because otherwise you are clever, sharp\nand you excel at everything you do: design, build, sketch, present, care, yap, love. Your love is\nenough. You are enough.\n\nHow honeyed, feminine your laugh. How loyal, responsive that you earned my trust in such a\nshort while. How strong your love that you never let me go. How strong your love that you donâ€™t\ngive up. How obsessive that you discuss me with your friends and associate so many things with\nthe name Sam. Is it selfish to say that I am glad the schmuck before me couldnâ€™t see your worth?\nThatâ€™s why I got so lucky! You are with me now and I am not gonna fumble you. \n\nSam and Sam\ntill the end of time."

        content: "Dear Sam,\n\nToday marks the first month since we started talking.\n\nI dived into your world, saw your quirkiness, and felt your loveâ€”so overwhelming that even when you try to contain it, it spills over like an overflowing honeycomb. And I want to savor every last drop of it. I'll never let any of your love go to waste. Every picture, update, voice note, video, stream, fit-check, and shared moment stays with me. Iâ€™ve met your family, your friends, and your pets. I felt at home in your little world almost instantly.\n\nWe discovered our mutual lovesâ€”letters, online dates, family-oriented mindsets, dark humor, twisted jokes, and some things I canâ€™t mention here. We share a hatred for stupidity, woke culture, and modern decadence. Even our humor alignsâ€”suicide jokes and all (Iâ€™m kidding, of course).\n\nThere have been arguments, disagreements, and painful conversations. But our love has proven stronger each time, and weâ€™ve come out of every challenge even more madly in love. (Okay, I do sound like an old man here, but youâ€™ll have to get used to my alternating minds.)\n\nI have loved the sun and the moon from millions of kilometers away. I have marveled at the beauty of black holes and warm holes that lie millions of light-years from me. I have spent entire days pondering the mystery of the beginning of time, 14.2 billion years distant. But I have never hated distance more than I despise the 1,221 kilometers between your city and mine. Twelve hundred and twenty-one kilometersâ€”I will never forget the trauma this number has given me. I have hated it every time you wanted a hug, a kiss, or a cuddle, and I couldnâ€™t give it to you because of this fucking distance.\n\nEven now, as I write this letter, you are on my mind. You just told me youâ€™re feeling weak and might faint. Iâ€™m constantly worriedâ€”how is she? Does she have someone trustworthy with her? Is she sleeping with no one to adjust her scarf for her?\n\nSigh.\n\nYou are the ache in my heart, the coolness of my eyes, the gentle evening breeze that caresses my cheek after a scorching Karachi afternoon. Everything you are insecure about, I loveâ€”your nose, your accent, your you-know-what.\n\nYou are a special woman, Fatima Abrar. Precious beyond words. I love every part of your mind, soul, and body. I want to reach every pore of youâ€”through talking, sharing, suffering, growing, and yes, through passion. Until there is a part of Samad in every corner of Fatima. Until you are completely mine. When that day comes, I will know that no man has ever loved a woman more than I love you.\n\nFor you and I will be one for eternity, our story floating through history, etching itself into time.\n\nI love you, meri jaanâ€”now and forever.\n\nYours, and only yours, now and forever,\nAbdul Samad Khan\n\nP.S. Itâ€™s possible that when I send you this, I wonâ€™t be home. So youâ€™ll have enough time to type your reply before I return."
